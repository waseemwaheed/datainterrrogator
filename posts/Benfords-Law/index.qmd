# Benford's law
Few days ago, I was introduced to the Benford's law of distribution. Looking up the internet for accessible explanation, I came across a basic introduction with very interesting explanation on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/logarithmic-scale/v/vi-and-sal-talk-about-the-mysteries-of-benford-s-law). Sal mentioned the typical example of the world countries populations follow this fascinating distribution function.

After few seconds of thinking about it, I decided to confirm this claim, So, I quickly pulled the data from wikipedia  and coded a quick and dirty experiment. And sure it works as you can see bellow
