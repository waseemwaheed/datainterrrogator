    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing data analysis, in many cases, requires loading the data from a database. Database engines are optimized for the efficient handling of data storage and retrieval. If the data is structured, which means the data follows a schema, querying the database is always performed using SQL, a domain specific language for data querying among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been using Jupyter notebooks for 4 years now, and I think the notebook concept is transformational. Being able to mix the analysis with the compute in one linear document is great. The other day I was looking at some SQL queries and thought to myself, I wish that could write those queries in Jupyter notebooks just like I do with Python, I had previously tried Matlab and Julia, why not SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you would imagine, the community has thought about this question way before I did and someone has made that possible in the form of a IPython extension 😍.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is my attempt at using SQL in the Jupyter notebook environment. The data we are going to use in this excercise the **20 years of Olympic history: athletes and results** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results). The analysis presented here is for practice only and for more detailed analysis of the olympic games, check [Olympians are probably older — and younger — than you think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/31/oldest-youngest-olympians/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have few reasons for writing this article:\n",
    "1. As a reminder for my future self, cause I tend to move on and forget 😅 as you can imagine,\n",
    "2. I hope it serves as an inspiration to you, the reader, to utilize this capability if you like it,\n",
    "3. Practice SQL, which I can't have enough of,\n",
    "4. Being able to send the calculations to the data rather than bring the data to compute is a super power in the Big Data era,\n",
    "5. Bringing the result of SQL queries back to Python rather than querying the database directly or using something like [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) or [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) allows us to visualize the data in whatever way we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that whatever we are doing here can be done within `Pandas` directly, however from a [scalability and effeciency perspectives](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/scale.html), the ability to do most of the filtering and summerization at the database level is a clear advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The database can be hosted anywhere. Which means the machine on which the analysis is carried out doesn't need to be highly resourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not an ORM?\n",
    "ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping which according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping):\n",
    "> a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a \"virtual object database\" that can be used from within the programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORMs hide the typical SQL interaction from the software developer, exposing the database as classes and objects with getters and setters. An typical example of an ORM are `SQLAlchemy` and `SQLModel` which builds on top `SQLAlchemy`. If you think that this is a good idea, I tend to agree as do most web frameworks but, the goal of this article is not to run away from SQL but to embrace it as universal tool that can be utilized on its own and in combination with most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not Spark (or the likes)\n",
    "This is a great question. If you have heard of Big Data tools such as [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), this question would defintely come to your mind. Spark does what we are trying to achieve, and I am planning to cover it in a follow up writeup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, I managed to convince you of the benefits of being able to query databases using SQL rather than doing the same analysis in Pandas.\n",
