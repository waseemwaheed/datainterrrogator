To allow for accurate scheduling of the monitoring program, they need to have an accurate asset register. \n\nThe organization was in the process of establishing a centralized asset register, with data primarily captured in spreadsheets by various teams. This presented challenges for monitoring technicians, who would often discover newly installed assets during on-site monitoring visits. This disrupted the monitoring schedule, as the organization was undergoing a period of growth and new assets were being introduced frequently.\n\nIn summary, newly installed assets were not documented anywhere for the monitoring team and other teams to manage properly.\n\nIf you are thinking wow, data about the asset is being captured once every year!

That is easier said than done 🤭.\n\nThe project face numerous challenges including:\n\n1. Monitoring data was not normalized and didn't adhere to a unified data model.

Time limitation.\n\nTo be able to deliver an improvement, I had to split the project into phases, outlining what can be expected at the end of each phase. These phases had to avoid introducing any breaking changes to the process.\n\nBy the end of the time allocated to the project, I was able to finish the first phase, which delivered: \n\n1. a centralized spreadsheet,\n2. with a data model,\n3. and instructions on how data should be captured to guarantee uniqueness and consistency.\n4. A working process that guarantees recency in terms of the deployed assets.\n5. A documentation of what the next phase should deliver.\n\n## 3️⃣ Reflection\n\nAmong the skills, working on this project has highlighted are the:\n\n1. Ability to manage change ✨, this goes beyond basic communications.
